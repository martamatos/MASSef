    This abstract class defines the basic structure of a global
    optimization problem. Subclasses should implement the generator 
    and evaluator methods for a particular optimization problem, 
    which can be used with ECsPy evolutionary computations. 
    
    In addition to being used with evolutionary computations, subclasses
    of this are also callable. the arguments passed to such a call are
    combined into a list and passed as the single candidate to the 
    evaluator method. The single calculated fitness is returned.
